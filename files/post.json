                    "text": "CS2 skins are cosmetics that change how your guns, knives, and gloves look. There are also Agent skins that change your character model. \n\nCounter-Strike skins are purely cosmetic, in that they are not designed to change any gameplay aspect of CS, although some players might feel their best using their favourite guns or knives. Despite not having an appreciable effect in-game, CS2 skins are highly sought-after items owing to their rarity and monetary value.\n\nSeveral variables make up every skin. Each variable directly impacts the value of the rare CS2 skins you will unbox or buy. In a broad sense, the value of a weapon is primarily determined by its rarity coupled with its desirability.\n\nCondition, Wear, and Float all refer to the condition of the weapon\u2019s finish. Starting with Factory New and ending with Battle-Scarred, all CS2 weapons with a skin exist on a spectrum of wear from 0 to 1. \n\nFactory New weapons will have the skin\u2019s design largely intact, with higher ratings having more and more imperfections.\n\nGenerally speaking, weapons with less wear are more valuable on the market; however, extremely high float skins can be valuable if they are unusually high in that regard.\n\n",

For Pattern-based skins, this number determines which part of the texture\u2019s base image is superimposed onto the gun.\n\nEach theoretical pattern is rare, as there are 1,001 potential patterns, but some are more desirable due to the finish. For example, \u2018Blue Gems\u2019 are Case Hardened CS2 skins with an unusual amount of blue as part of the weapon. The best possible patterns for Blue Gems are among the most expensive skins in the game.\n\nDoppler and Gamma Doppler knives have a similar system. Knives can be one of several variations, with the rarest type once again referred to as \u2018Gems\u2019 by the CS2 community. \n\nA Doppler knife can be a Sapphire 1 (1 in 100), Ruby (1 in 100), or Black Pearl (1 in 1000), and a Gamma Doppler can be an Emerald (1 in 100), with the remaining probabilities shared between Phases 1-4 of each knife.",
